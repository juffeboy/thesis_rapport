\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize your contributions\\
The contributions of this report is an algortihm that allows a consumer to follow the data created, in a periodic interval, on a sensor node. 
The data is received in the shortest available time from 
The time from when the data was created until it has been received at the 

\item Conclusions from the results
\item Implications for the future 
\item Be breif!

\item Its a suitable system. Works flawlessly.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the useability of ICN in the IoT domain. If it is a suitible candidate that potentially could replace MQTT as an communication paradigm.
The evaluation considered performance measurements of application components, its overall latency and the feasibility of using IoT in the IoT domain.

The performance evaluation showed that there were no major drawbacks in time when using the CCN application in comparission to 


\begin{itemize}
\item kort om vad som har gjortst
\item beskrvi performance evaluation
\item beskriv feasibile evaluation
\item beskrvi den mer i detalj.
\item beskriv helheten att det fungerar bra om man kor det i bode kortare och langre tidsserier.
\end{itemize}
