The aim of this study was to evaluate the useability of ICN in the IoT domain. If it is a suitible candidate that potentially could replace MQTT as an communication paradigm.
The evaluation considered performance measurements of application components, its overall latency and the feasibility of using IoT in the IoT domain.

The performance evaluation showed that the CCN-lite application is successful in deliver a low latency between a sensornode and its gateway. 
When using the CCN peek application to retrieve data from the sensors CCN-lite application, it performs only a few milliseconds slower compared to the ping counterpart.

The optimization of the CCN-lite application code at the sensor shows that part of the long round trip times experienced earlier was due to various debug messages that was printed on the console. Furthermore, the sensor was put into sleep mode of a short period of time for each \textit{interest} message it received. The optimization of the code resulted in around 100 ms faster round trip times compared to before. From round trip times of 130 ms to less than 30 ms.

The suitability evaluation showed that ICN is successful in retreiving low latency values between data creation until it reaches the user. When using of ICNs \textit{PIT} and sending the \textit{interest} messages before the data has been created, ICN can eliminate unnecessary waiting time between data creation and until it is sent. Thereby achiving similar latencies as using MQTT.

The algortihm presented in this thesis is a first shot to pull data that is periodically produced at a fixed interval. The algorithm proved to be successful in retreiving data over long periods of time, no timeouts occured. %In order for it to work properly, it needs a reference time, the length of the interval, 

%In order for it to work properly, it needs a reference time, length of the interval, 
%It was successful in pulling data even though there was a high $\alpha$,
%Even though the $\alpha$ parameter was changed, which made the round trip times alternate more, the algorithm proved to be stable and successful in retreiving the data.
Even though round trips alternated, sometimes because of high $\alpha$, the algorithm proved to stay stable and successful in retreiving the data.

\item Total verdict
TOTAL verdict.
The two evaluations combined, have shown that it is feasible to use ICN as a communication paradigm in the IoT domian.

\begin{itemize}
\item kort om vad som har gjortst
\item beskrvi performance evaluation
\item beskriv feasibile evaluation
\item beskrvi den mer i detalj.
\item beskriv helheten att det fungerar bra om man kor det i bode kortare och langre tidsserier.
