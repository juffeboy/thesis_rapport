The aim of this study was to evaluate a subset of ideas of the use of information-centric networks in the IoT domain. The evaluation was considered from both performance and a feasibility perspective.

The evaluation considered both performance measurements of CCN application components and feasibility of 

The performance evaluation has shown that the latency of the CCN application is successfull in delivering the data at good speed.


The evaluation considered both performance measurements in CCN application components, its latency overal and feasibility of using 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the useability of ICN in the IoT domain.

The evaluation considered performance measurements of application components, its overal latency and the feasibility of using CCN in the IoT domain.
