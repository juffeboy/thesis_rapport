\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize your contributions\\
The contributions of this report is an algortihm that allows a consumer to follow the data created, in a periodic interval, on a sensor node. 
The data is received in the shortest available time from 
The time from when the data was created until it has been received at the 

\item Conclusions from the results
\item Implications for the future 
\item Be breif!

\item Its a suitable system. Works flawlessly.
\end{itemize} 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the useability of ICN in the IoT domain. If it is a suitible candidate that potentially could replace MQTT as an communication paradigm.
The evaluation considered performance measurements of application components, its overall latency and the feasibility of using IoT in the IoT domain.

The performance evaluation has showed that the CCN-lite application is successful in deliver a low latency between a sensornode and its gateway. 
When using the CCN peek application to retrieve data from the sensors CCN-lite application, it performs only a few milliseconds slower compared to the ping counterpart.

The optimization of the CCN-lite application code at the sensor shows that part of the long round trip times earlier stated was due to various debug messages that was printed on the console. Furthermore, the sensor was put into sleep mode of a short period of time for each \textit{interest} message it received. 

\begin{itemize}
\item kort om vad som har gjortst
\item beskrvi performance evaluation
\item beskriv feasibile evaluation
\item beskrvi den mer i detalj.
\item beskriv helheten att det fungerar bra om man kor det i bode kortare och langre tidsserier.
\end{itemize}
