%\begin{itemize}
%\item Describe the greater contest, what are the technologies and protocols figuring in the thesis.
%\item Mention both IoT and ICN and wave them together somehow.
%\item describe the growing number of IoT devices.
%\end{itemize}


A total of 26 billion IoT units installed world wide is estimated in the year of 2020. It represents a stagering 30 time increase from the year of 2009, where a total of 0.9 billion units was installed \cite{Gartner}. The increase in demand has led to that several major manufactures has joined the market, which in turn has led to several different communcation standards that the IoT devices communicates with. 

A new communication protocol are not developed overnight. It takes severe amount of reasearch and time to develope a new protocol. A majority of the network protocols and systems in this thesis were developed during the 1990s or early 2000. Although ICN was coined in 2000 with the TRIAD paper \cite{TRIAD}, it was not until 2009 when Jacobsson et al \cite{Jacobson2009} when it started to draw attention.

Each operating system and protocol of communication has its own restriction and possibility in delivering sensor data from a producer to a consumer.
In this section, systems and protcols used in this thesis is described that can be applied in wireless sensor networks.
