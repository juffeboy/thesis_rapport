%\begin{itemize}
%\item Describe the greater contest, what are the technologies and protocols figuring in the thesis.
%\item Mention both IoT and ICN and wave them together somehow.
%\item describe the growing number of IoT devices.
%\end{itemize}
In the year of 2020 a total of 26 billion IoT units is estimated to be installed world wide. It represents a staggering 30 time increase from the year of 2009, where a total of 0.9 billion units was installed \cite{Gartner}. The increase in demand has led to several major manufactures joining the market, which in turn led to several different communcation standards which the IoT devices communicates with. 

A new communication protocol is not developed overnight. It takes severe amount of reasearch and time to develop a new protocol. A majority of the network protocols and systems in this thesis was developed during the 1990s or early 2000. Although ICN was coined in 2000 with the TRIAD paper \cite{TRIAD}, it was not until Jacobsson et al in 2009 \cite{Jacobson2009}, it started to draw attention.

Each operating system and protocol of communication has its own restriction and possibility in delivering sensor data from a producer to a consumer.
In this section, the systems and protcols used in this thesis are described which can be applied in wireless sensor networks.
