\subsection{Future work}
%To further explore the usage of ICN in IoT networks there are several interesting aspects to consider.
This thesis only showed a subset of the performance and suitability of using ICN in IoT networks. There are several other interesting aspects to consider for future studies. 


\begin{itemize}
\item Scalability
\end{itemize}
%The scalability aspect is 
\begin{itemize}
\item Interval changes on the sensor. Now the drift is constant. Would be interesting to see how it could handle a variated interval.
\end{itemize}
